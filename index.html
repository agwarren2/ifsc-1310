      Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement: 
  </h2>
  <body>
      progressive enhancement is a website that is first made very simple, for the user, yet added to later as it goes to make it more user friendly if needed with the information.
      what i mean by that is, as there is added information to a base code format, the web developer can mark up the code as needed. 
      this is very important in the web technology department because of websites being user friendly and how they look on a page on the browser. websites are everything in todays society, so if it isnt user friendly, it isnt going to be very popular or well rated to be used. 
      a big example in my opinion of showing progressive enhancement is wikipedia, multiple users can go to the site and edit as needed, with new up to date information. they use this type of system for the users by possibly adding and editing paragraphs or other links that are correct and up to date. 
      wikipedia has always been known to be the universal site that people can code on and be a developer on. 
      a link that i learned more about progressive enhancement is https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/

  <h3>SpaceX Revision Reflection</h3>

  <body>
      i had my mom look at the page i created regarding the spacex information. she took a look at it and said that the colors and fonts did not match up wth the rest of the page format.
      i understood where she was coming from in the design element of the page, yet other than that she honestly didnt really know how to critique the page. 
      if i had to start over on this project, i would have tried to go more out of my comfort zone in the image department, and trying to make all of them very different, yet make up for the uniqueness by the rest of the same fonts. 
      i was worried with this project that if i did go out of my comfort zone in different versions of code, that i would make myself lost and not know how to correct certain mistakes possibly made. 
      
      throughout this process in creating the page with the given information about the spacex dragon, it was definitely a learning curve in seeing how to create code and marking up code with my own thought process. yet the experience was not bad in this assignment that we had to do and revise with feedback. 
      with the feedback given to me by just my mom instead of another family member, i do feel like i could have gotten a more detailed response in the critiquing category. 
      i think that i did a good job on making sure every part was marked up correctly to where the code when verified/checked, was correct or fixed if needed.
